# TODO

* output save is not a png when png chosen (maybe just file extension)
* next story is 2.5.4 (in progress) then 3.1 and 3.2
* shader switching on primitives?
* need to stop spinning on render probably
* Does it supprt resize live?
* reflections broken
* getting a wait or terminate again
* realtime preview? (I think we should do a course correct here)
