# TODO

* output save is not a png when png chosen (maybe just file extension)
* mouse just keeps moving when in camera control, it's not 1 to 1 it's almost like it's buffered
* next story is 2.5.4 then 3.1 and 3.2
* shader switching on primitives?
* get a popup while progressive rendering that the program has stopped responding, wait or kill.
