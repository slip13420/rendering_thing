# Introduction

This document captures the CURRENT STATE of the New Renderer path tracing project, including the existing CPU-based implementation and architectural requirements for GPU acceleration integration. It serves as a reference for AI agents implementing Epic 2.5 (GPU Acceleration) before Epic 3 (Scene & Primitive Management).

## Document Scope

**Focused on areas relevant to: GPU Acceleration Integration (Epic 2.5)**
- Current CPU-based rendering pipeline analysis
- GPU acceleration integration points
- Performance optimization requirements
- Architectural enhancement for Epic 3 preparation
