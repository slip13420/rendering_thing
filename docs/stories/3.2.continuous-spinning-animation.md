# Story 3.2: Continuous Spinning Animation

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** the primitives in the scene to have a continuous spinning animation,  
**so that** I can see the effects of lighting and reflections in motion.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All primitives in the scene continuously rotate around their individual axes using GPU-accelerated animation
2. Animation speed is consistent and visually appealing with GPU-optimized performance
3. Each primitive type can have its own unique rotation pattern computed on GPU
4. Animation continues smoothly during GPU-accelerated progressive rendering
5. Animation state is properly managed in both CPU and GPU memory when primitives are added or removed
6. GPU animation computation scales efficiently with primitive count (20-50x speedup for many primitives)
7. Animation can be paused and resumed through user controls with GPU state synchronization
8. GPU animation integrates seamlessly with GPU-accelerated path tracing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

This story builds on the complete GPU acceleration foundation:
- **Epic 2.5 (GPU Acceleration)**: Complete GPU compute pipeline, memory management, and accelerated path tracing
- **Story 3.1 (GPU-Enhanced Primitive Management)**: GPU-accelerated primitive management with efficient CPU-GPU synchronization
- **GPU Performance Target**: 20-50x speedup for animation of many primitives through GPU parallel computation
- **GPU Memory System**: Efficient GPU buffer management ready for animation state storage

The GPU animation system will provide massive parallel computation for smooth, high-performance primitive animation.

### GPU Acceleration Integration Context

#### Component Integration Flow

[Source: architecture/component_breakdown.md and Story 3.1]
Animation update data flow:

5. **Progressive Rendering** captures animated scene state for each render pass

**Primitives & Animations Enhanced Responsibilities:**

### Technical Implementation Details

**GPU Animation Compute Shader:**
```glsl
#version 430
layout(local_size_x = 64, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;

layout(std430, binding = 0) buffer AnimationBuffer {
    GPUAnimationData animations[];
};

layout(std430, binding = 1) buffer PrimitiveBuffer {
    GPUPrimitiveData primitives[];
};

uniform float deltaTime;
uniform float globalTime;

void main() {
    uint index = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;
    if (index >= animations.length()) return;
    
    // Update rotation based on time and speed
    animations[index].rotationX += animations[index].speedX * deltaTime;
    animations[index].rotationY += animations[index].speedY * deltaTime;
    animations[index].rotationZ += animations[index].speedZ * deltaTime;
    
    // Update primitive transform matrix
    mat4 rotMatrix = buildRotationMatrix(
        animations[index].rotationX,
        animations[index].rotationY,
        animations[index].rotationZ
    );
    
    // Store updated transform in primitive data
    primitives[index].transform = rotMatrix;
}
```

**GPU Animation State Management:**
```cpp
struct GPUAnimationData {
    float rotationX, rotationY, rotationZ;
    float speedX, speedY, speedZ;
    float padding[2];  // GPU alignment
};

class GPUAnimationManager {
public:
    bool initializeAnimationBuffers(int maxPrimitives);
    void updateAnimations(float deltaTime);
    void addPrimitiveAnimation(PrimitiveID id, const AnimationPattern& pattern);
    void removePrimitiveAnimation(PrimitiveID id);
    
    // GPU compute dispatch
    void dispatchAnimationCompute();
    GLuint getAnimationBuffer() const { return animationBuffer_; }
    
private:
    GLuint animationComputeProgram_;
    GLuint animationBuffer_;
    GLuint primitiveBuffer_;
    int primitiveCount_;
};
};
```

**GPU-Optimized Animation Patterns:**
- **Sphere**: Single-axis Y rotation optimized for GPU parallel computation
- **Cube**: Dual-axis XY rotation with GPU-efficient matrix calculations
- **Torus**: Y-axis rotation with GPU-accelerated torus lighting effects
- **Pyramid**: Complex rotation pattern computed in parallel across all pyramid instances

**GPU Performance Optimization:**
- All primitive animations computed in parallel using GPU compute shaders
- Animation state stored in GPU buffer objects for minimal CPU-GPU transfer
- 20-50x speedup for scenes with many animated primitives
- GPU workload scales linearly with primitive count

**Animation Timing System:**
- High-resolution timer for smooth frame-rate independent animation
- Delta time calculation between animation updates
- Rotation accumulation with proper wrap-around (0-2π)
- Animation speed calibrated for visually pleasing motion (~0.5-2.0 rad/sec)

**Transform Matrix Integration:**
- Animation updates modify primitive transform matrices
- Path tracer uses current transform for ray-primitive intersection tests
- Rotation order: Z-Y-X for predictable rotation composition
- Transform matrix cached and updated only when animation state changes

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Considerations:**
- Animation updates must not significantly impact rendering performance
- Transform matrix calculations optimized for real-time updates
- Animation timing should be smooth across varying frame rates
- Memory efficient storage of animation state per primitive instance

**Rendering Integration Constraints:**
- Animated transforms must be thread-safe for path tracer access
- Animation updates coordinate with progressive rendering timing
- Scene changes (add/remove primitives) must not disrupt ongoing animations
- Animation state must be consistent across render pipeline stages

**Animation Timing Constraints:**
- Smooth animation requires consistent high-resolution timing
- Animation continues during pause/resume of rendering process
- Frame rate independence ensures consistent animation speed
- Animation state properly initialized for newly added primitives

**Architecture Constraints:**
- Animation system must integrate with existing Scene Manager patterns
- Primitive transform updates must not break path tracer intersection tests
- Animation timing must coordinate with render engine main loop
- UI animation controls must follow established UI Manager event patterns

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- tests/core/primitives_animation_test.cpp - Animation timing and rotation calculations
- tests/core/scene_manager_animation_test.cpp - Scene animation coordination
- tests/render/animation_integration_test.cpp - Animation-render pipeline integration

- Unit tests for animation timing calculations and rotation math
- Unit tests for transform matrix updates from animation state
- Integration tests for animation coordination with Scene Manager
- Performance tests for animation impact on rendering pipeline
- Visual verification tests for smooth animation appearance

**Test Scenarios:**

- Rotation calculations and transform matrix updates
- Animation state management during primitive add/remove operations
- Animation integration with progressive rendering cycles
- Performance impact measurement of animations on render times
- Visual smoothness verification across different animation speeds
- Animation pause/resume functionality (if implemented)

**Animation Quality Validation:**
- Rotation speeds produce visually appealing motion
- Different primitive types have distinct, recognizable animation patterns
- Animation smoothness maintained during scene complexity changes
- No visual artifacts or stuttering during animation updates
