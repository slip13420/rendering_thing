# Story 3.1: Add and Remove Primitives

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to add and remove primitives (torus, sphere, pyramid, and cube) from the scene,  
**so that** I can build a custom scene.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User can add primitives (torus, sphere, pyramid, cube) to the scene through UI controls
2. User can remove existing primitives from the scene through UI controls
3. Scene updates in real-time to reflect additions and removals with GPU acceleration
4. System maintains the state of all primitives in both CPU and GPU memory
5. Multiple instances of the same primitive type can exist simultaneously
6. UI provides clear visual indication of available and selected primitives
7. GPU memory is efficiently updated when primitives are added or removed
8. GPU-accelerated rendering reflects scene changes with optimal performance

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story builds upon the completed GPU acceleration foundation from Epic 2.5:
- **Epic 2.5.1 (GPU Compute Shader Integration)**: GPU compute pipeline and CPU fallback established
- **Epic 2.5.2 (GPU Memory Management)**: Efficient CPU-GPU data transfer and memory coordination ready
- **Epic 2.5.3 (GPU-Accelerated Path Tracing)**: GPU ray tracing with 5-10x performance improvement active
- **Epic 2.5.4 (GPU Performance Optimization)**: GPU performance monitoring and optimization available

This story leverages GPU acceleration to enable high-performance dynamic primitive management with real-time scene updates.

### Architecture Context

#### System Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/integration-points-and-external-dependencies.md]
GPU-accelerated scene management integrates with GPU acceleration components:
- **Scene Manager**: Enhanced with GPU memory coordination for primitive management
- **GPU Memory Manager**: Handles efficient CPU-GPU primitive data synchronization
- **GPU-Accelerated Path Tracer**: Queries GPU scene buffers for ray-primitive intersections
- **GPU Performance Monitor**: Tracks performance impact of dynamic scene changes
- **UI Manager**: Provides user controls with GPU performance feedback

#### Component Integration Flow
[Source: architecture/component_breakdown.md]
Primitive management data flow:
1. **UI Manager** handles user add/remove requests from interface controls
2. **Scene Manager** processes requests and updates internal primitive collections
3. **Render Engine** detects scene changes and initiates new rendering cycle
4. **Path Tracer Module** queries Scene Manager for updated primitive list during ray intersections

**Scene Manager Enhanced Responsibilities:**
- Maintains the state of the 3D world with all primitives, their properties, and light sources
- Provides API for the UI to add, remove, and modify objects
- Manages unique identification system for individual primitive instances
- Coordinates scene state changes with rendering pipeline

**Primitives & Animations Enhanced Responsibilities:**
- Contains data structures for each primitive type (torus, sphere, pyramid, cube) 
- Supports unique instance identification for removal operations
- Managed by the Scene Manager with dynamic add/remove capabilities

#### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/technology_stack.md]
- **Programming Language**: C++17 or newer - Object-oriented primitive management
- **Build System**: CMake - Automatic compilation of new primitive classes
- **External Libraries**: SDL or GLFW - UI controls for primitive management

### Technical Implementation Details

**GPU-Accelerated Primitive Management System:**
```cpp
// GPU-friendly primitive data structure
struct GPUPrimitiveData {
    float position[4];      // Aligned for GPU
    float rotation[4];      // Quaternion representation
    float scale[4];         // Uniform scaling with padding
    uint32_t type;          // Primitive type enum
    uint32_t id;            // Unique primitive identifier
    float padding[2];       // GPU alignment padding
};

class SceneManager {
public:
    PrimitiveID addPrimitive(PrimitiveType type);
    bool removePrimitive(PrimitiveID id);
    
    // GPU acceleration methods
    void syncPrimitivesToGPU();
    void updateGPUPrimitive(PrimitiveID id);
    GLuint getGPUSceneBuffer() const;
    
private:
    std::shared_ptr<GPUMemoryManager> gpuMemory_;
    GLuint sceneGPUBuffer_;
    bool gpuSyncRequired_;
};
```

**GPU-Optimized Primitive Types:**
- **Torus**: GPU-friendly data layout with major/minor radius and efficient intersection
- **Sphere**: Optimized GPU representation with center and radius for fast ray-sphere tests
- **Pyramid**: Triangle-based representation optimized for GPU triangle intersection
- **Cube**: Box primitive with min/max bounds for efficient GPU ray-box intersection

**GPU Memory Integration:**
- All primitives stored in GPU buffers using structure-of-arrays layout
- Efficient CPU-GPU synchronization when primitives added/removed
- GPU memory pool optimization for dynamic primitive allocation
- Real-time GPU buffer updates coordinated with rendering pipeline

**UI Control Layout:**
- Add buttons for each primitive type (4 buttons: Torus, Sphere, Pyramid, Cube)
- Primitive list display showing current scene contents
- Remove button/mechanism for selected primitives
- Visual feedback for successful add/remove operations

**Scene Update Coordination:**
- Scene Manager notifies Render Engine of changes
- Render Engine triggers new progressive rendering cycle
- Path Tracer queries updated primitive list for ray intersections
- UI updates to reflect current scene state

### Technical Constraints

**Scene Management Constraints:**
- Primitive instances must have unique identifiers for individual removal
- Scene state must be thread-safe for rendering coordination
- Add/remove operations should not disrupt ongoing render processes
- Memory management for dynamic primitive creation/destruction

**Performance Considerations:**
- Efficient primitive lookup for ray intersection tests
- Minimal overhead for scene state queries during rendering
- Fast add/remove operations that don't block UI responsiveness
- Memory efficient storage of multiple primitive instances

**Integration Constraints:**
- Scene changes must coordinate with render engine timing
- Path tracer must handle dynamic scene updates without crashes
- UI controls must follow established UI Manager patterns
- Primitive management must not interfere with existing camera/render controls

**Architecture Constraints:**
- Scene Manager must maintain API compatibility with existing render pipeline
- Primitive classes must support path tracer intersection testing
- UI integration must follow established UI Manager event handling patterns
- Changes must not break existing save/load functionality (Story 2.5)

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- tests/core/scene_manager_test.cpp - Scene Manager primitive management
- tests/core/primitives_test.cpp - Individual primitive class functionality  
- tests/ui/ui_manager_test.cpp - UI controls for primitive add/remove
- tests/core/primitive_integration_test.cpp - End-to-end primitive lifecycle testing

**Testing Requirements** (Following established project patterns):
- Unit tests for Scene Manager add/remove primitive methods
- Unit tests for each primitive type implementation
- Unit tests for UI primitive management controls
- Integration tests for scene updates with rendering pipeline
- Performance tests for scene queries during ray tracing

**Test Scenarios:**
- Add each primitive type individually and verify scene state
- Remove specific primitives by ID and verify scene updates
- Add multiple instances of same primitive type
- UI control interaction for primitive management
- Scene state consistency after multiple add/remove operations
- Rendering pipeline integration with dynamic scene changes
- Error handling for invalid primitive removal requests
