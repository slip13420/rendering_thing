# Story 1.3: Documented File Structure

## Status
InProgress

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** the project to have a clear, documented file structure,  
**so that** I can easily navigate the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Project directory structure is logically organized by component/functionality
2. File naming conventions are consistent and descriptive
3. Directory structure is documented with purpose of each folder
4. Source code organization aligns with the system architecture
5. Documentation clearly explains where to find different types of files

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Design directory structure (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Create src/ directory for source code
  - [ ] Organize directories by architectural components (ui/, core/, render/)
  - [ ] Create include/ directory for header files
  - [ ] Set up tests/ directory structure
  - [ ] Create assets/ directory for resources
- [ ] Task 2: Establish naming conventions (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Define file naming patterns (.cpp/.hpp extensions)
  - [ ] Create consistent directory naming scheme
  - [ ] Document naming conventions for different file types
- [ ] Task 3: Create structure documentation (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Write PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md or update README
  - [ ] Document purpose and contents of each directory
  - [ ] Explain file organization principles
  - [ ] Add examples of where to place new files
- [ ] Task 4: Align with architecture (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Map directories to architectural components
  - [ ] Ensure UI Layer components have dedicated location
  - [ ] Organize Core Logic components logically
  - [ ] Separate external dependencies and internal code
- [ ] Task 5: Update build system (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Update CMakeLists.txt to reflect new structure
  - [ ] Configure include directories
  - [ ] Set up source file organization in build

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story builds on Stories 1.1 (Cross-Platform Build System) and 1.2 (Automatic Dependency Management). The file structure must support the CMake build system and integrate with the dependency management setup.

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/high_level_architecture.md]
The application follows a clear separation of concerns with distinct layers:
- **UI Layer**: UI Manager, User Input handling components
- **Core Logic**: Scene Manager, Render Engine, Path Tracer Module, Primitives & Animations, Image Output

The file structure should reflect this architectural separation to maintain code organization and facilitate development.

[Source: architecture/component_breakdown.md]
Key architectural components that need dedicated locations:
- **UI Layer Components**: UI Manager, UI Input
- **Core Logic Components**: Scene Manager, Primitives & Animations, Render Engine, Path Tracer Module, Image Output
- **External Integrations**: Windowing library interfaces (SDL/GLFW)

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: architecture/technology_stack.md]
- **Programming Language**: C++17 - Structure must support .cpp/.hpp file organization
- **Build System**: CMake - Directory structure must be CMake-friendly
- **External Libraries**: SDL/GLFW - Clear separation of external vs internal code

### Technical Implementation Details

**Proposed Directory Structure:**
```
new_renderer/
├── src/
│   ├── ui/           # UI Layer components
│   ├── core/         # Core Logic components  
│   ├── render/       # Rendering-specific code
│   └── main.cpp      # Application entry point
├── include/
│   ├── ui/           # UI Layer headers
│   ├── core/         # Core Logic headers
│   └── render/       # Rendering headers
├── tests/
│   ├── ui/           # UI component tests
│   ├── core/         # Core component tests
│   └── render/       # Rendering tests
├── assets/           # Resources, shaders, etc.
├── docs/             # Documentation (existing)
└── build/            # Build output (generated)
```

### File Naming Conventions
- Source files: lowercase with underscores (e.g., `scene_manager.cpp`)
- Header files: matching source names (e.g., `scene_manager.hpp`)
- Class names: PascalCase (e.g., `SceneManager`)
- Directory names: lowercase, descriptive (e.g., `ui/`, `render/`)

### Testing
- **Structure Validation**: Verify directories exist and are properly organized
- **Build Integration**: Ensure CMake correctly finds and compiles files
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Verify documentation matches actual structure
- **Navigation Testing**: Confirm logical organization aids code discovery

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing CMake build system from Story 1.1
- Must accommodate dependency management from Story 1.2
- Should facilitate future development of architectural components
- Must support C++17 compilation and linking requirements
