## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story completes the Epic 2 rendering pipeline by adding export capability:
- **Story 2.1 (PathTracer)**: Generates the pixel data that needs to be saved
- **Story 2.2 (Camera Control)**: Camera position affects the composition of saved images
- **Story 2.3 (Render Control)**: Save operations should coordinate with render completion
- **Story 2.4 (Progressive Rendering)**: Save should capture final quality, not progressive preview
- **Image Output Module**: Existing architecture component designed to handle both screen display and file output

The save functionality is the final step in the rendering pipeline, converting internal pixel data to standard image files.

### Architecture Context

#### System Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/high_level_architecture.md]
Image saving integrates with existing components:
- **Image Output Module**: Handles final pixel data and sends to both screen buffer and file output
- **UI Manager**: Provides user controls for save operations and file selection
- **Render Engine**: Coordinates timing between render completion and save operations

#### Component Integration Flow
[Source: architecture/component_breakdown.md]
Save operation data flow:
1. **Render Engine** signals render completion with final image data
2. **UI Manager** enables save controls and handles user save requests
3. **Image Output Module** converts pixel data to file format and writes to disk
4. **UI Manager** provides user feedback on save success/failure

**Image Output Enhanced Responsibilities:**
- Handles final pixel data for both screen display and file export
- Writes image to files with format conversion and quality settings
- Manages file I/O operations and error handling

#### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/technology_stack.md]
- **Programming Language**: C++17 - File I/O and image format handling
- **Build System**: CMake - May need image format libraries (PNG, JPG)
- **External Libraries**: Consider image format libraries (libpng, libjpeg) or simple implementations

### File Locations and Structure

**Image Output File Writing:**
- **Implementation**: src/render/image_output.{cpp,h} - add file format writing
- **Headers**: include/render/image_output.h - file export interfaces

**UI Save Controls:**
- **Implementation**: src/ui/ui_manager.{cpp,h} - save button and file dialog
- **Input Handling**: src/ui/ui_input.{cpp,h} - save control event processing

**Format Support:**
- **Implementation**: Consider image_formats.{cpp,h} if complex format handling needed
- **Headers**: Format-specific utilities and conversion functions

**Testing:**
- **Image Tests**: tests/render/image_output_test.cpp - file writing and format accuracy
- **UI Tests**: tests/ui/ui_manager_test.cpp - save control functionality
- **Integration Tests**: tests/render/save_integration_test.cpp - end-to-end save workflow

### Technical Implementation Details

**Supported File Formats:**
```cpp
enum class ImageFormat {
    PNG,     // Lossless, good for high quality
    JPEG,    // Lossy with quality settings
    BMP      // Simple uncompressed (optional)
};

struct SaveOptions {
    ImageFormat format = ImageFormat::PNG;
    int jpegQuality = 90;     // 1-100 for JPEG compression
    bool includeMetadata = true;
};
```

**File Dialog Integration:**
- Native file dialog through SDL/GLFW or simple filename input
- Default filename with timestamp (e.g., "render_2025-08-13_14-30-25.png")
- File extension automatically added based on selected format
- Remember last save location for user convenience

**Image Data Conversion:**
- Convert from internal pixel format (likely float RGB) to file format
- Apply proper gamma correction for sRGB output
- Handle bit depth conversion (float â†’ 8-bit/16-bit integers)
- Preserve color accuracy and dynamic range where possible

**Error Handling Scenarios:**
- Invalid file path or filename
- Insufficient disk space
- File write permissions denied
- Unsupported characters in filename
- Network drive or external storage issues

### Technical Constraints

**File Format Considerations:**
- PNG: Lossless, larger files, good for archival quality
- JPEG: Lossy compression, smaller files, good for sharing
- Quality vs. file size trade-offs for compressed formats
- Color space and gamma correction requirements

**Performance Considerations:**
- File writing should not block UI during save operation
- Large images may require background saving with progress feedback
- Memory efficient conversion from internal to file format
- Temporary file handling for atomic saves (write to temp, then rename)

**Integration Constraints:**
- Save operations must wait for render completion
- Coordinate with progressive rendering to save final quality only
- Handle save requests during different render states appropriately
- Maintain UI responsiveness during file writing

**Architecture Constraints:**
- Image Output module must handle both screen display and file output
- UI controls must follow established UI Manager patterns
- File operations must be robust and provide appropriate user feedback
- Save functionality must not interfere with ongoing render operations

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- tests/render/image_output_test.cpp - File format writing and quality validation
- tests/ui/ui_manager_test.cpp - Save UI controls and file dialog
- tests/render/save_integration_test.cpp - End-to-end save workflow testing

**Testing Requirements** (Following established project patterns):
- Unit tests for image format conversion and file writing
- Unit tests for UI save controls and file dialog functionality
- Integration tests for save timing with render completion
- Error handling tests for various file system failures
- Quality validation tests for saved image accuracy

**Test Scenarios:**
- Save in different image formats (PNG, JPEG) with quality verification
- File dialog operation and filename/location selection
- Save success and error feedback to user
- Save operation timing relative to render completion
- Error handling for file system issues (permissions, disk space, etc.)
- Image quality preservation across format conversion

**Quality Validation Tests:**
- Pixel-level accuracy comparison between rendered and saved images
- Color space and gamma correction verification
- File format compliance and metadata accuracy
- Compression quality vs. file size validation for lossy formats
