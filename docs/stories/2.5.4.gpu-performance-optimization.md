**Critical OpenGL Context Threading Fix** (`src/render/path_tracer.cpp:700-732`):
```cpp
bool PathTracer::trace_hybrid(int width, int height) {
    // HYBRID_AUTO - decide based on performance heuristics AND thread context
    if (shouldUseGPU(width, height, samples_per_pixel_)) {
        // Check if we have OpenGL context (i.e., we're in main thread)
    #ifdef USE_GPU
        SDL_GLContext currentContext = SDL_GL_GetCurrentContext();
        if (currentContext) {
            std::cout << "Hybrid mode: Attempting GPU rendering (OpenGL context available)" << std::endl;
            if (trace_gpu(width, height)) {
                return true;
            } else {
                std::cout << "GPU rendering failed, falling back to CPU" << std::endl;
                return trace_interruptible(width, height);
            }
        } else {
            std::cout << "Hybrid mode: GPU selected but no OpenGL context (background thread) - using CPU" << std::endl;
            return trace_interruptible(width, height);
        }
    #endif
    }
    return trace_interruptible(width, height);
}
```

**Non-Blocking Progressive GPU Rendering** (`src/render/render_engine.cpp:848-904`):
```cpp
bool RenderEngine::start_progressive_gpu_non_blocking(const ProgressiveConfig& config) {
#ifdef USE_GPU
    if (!gpu_initialized_ || !path_tracer_ || !path_tracer_->isGPUAvailable()) {
        std::cerr << "GPU not available for progressive rendering" << std::endl;
        return false;
    }
    
    // Validate that we have an OpenGL context
    SDL_GLContext currentContext = SDL_GL_GetCurrentContext();
    if (!currentContext) {
        std::cerr << "ERROR: No OpenGL context in main thread" << std::endl;
        return false;
    }
    
    // Initialize progressive state machine
    progressive_gpu_state_.active = true;
    progressive_gpu_state_.current_step = 0;
    progressive_gpu_state_.current_samples = config.initialSamples;
    progressive_gpu_state_.target_samples = config.targetSamples;
    progressive_gpu_state_.total_steps = config.progressiveSteps;
    progressive_gpu_state_.update_interval = config.updateInterval;
    
    std::cout << "Progressive GPU rendering initialized (non-blocking mode)" << std::endl;
    return true;
#else
    return false;
#endif
}
```

**Direct Mouse Polling for Responsive Camera** (`src/ui/ui_input.cpp:412-453`):
```cpp
void UIInput::handle_direct_mouse_input() {
#ifdef USE_SDL
    // Only poll if mouse is captured
    if (!mouse_captured_) return;
    
    // Get current mouse position directly (no event queue)
    int current_x, current_y;
    SDL_GetMouseState(&current_x, &current_y);
    
    // Calculate deltas from last position
    int delta_x = current_x - last_mouse_x_;
    int delta_y = current_y - last_mouse_y_;
    
    // Update last position immediately
    last_mouse_x_ = current_x;
    last_mouse_y_ = current_y;
    
    // Skip tiny movements and cap deltas to prevent jumps
    if (abs(delta_x) <= 1 && abs(delta_y) <= 1) return;
    const int max_delta = 10;
    delta_x = std::max(-max_delta, std::min(max_delta, delta_x));
    delta_y = std::max(-max_delta, std::min(max_delta, delta_y));
    
    // Apply mouse look and update camera immediately
    camera_yaw_ += delta_x * mouse_sensitivity_;
    camera_pitch_ -= delta_y * mouse_sensitivity_;
    update_camera_target();
#endif
}
```

**Camera Preview Optimization** (`src/render/render_engine.cpp` - `update_camera_preview()` method):
```cpp
void RenderEngine::update_camera_preview(const Vector3& camera_pos, const Vector3& camera_target) {
    // Throttle camera preview updates to 50ms (20 FPS) for responsiveness
    static auto last_preview_time = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
    auto now = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
    auto elapsed = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(now - last_preview_time).count();
    
    if (elapsed < 50) {
        set_camera_position(camera_pos, camera_target);
        return;
    }
    
    // Use optimized settings for real-time camera preview
    path_tracer_->set_samples_per_pixel(2); // 2 samples for better quality
    path_tracer_->set_max_depth(2);         // Some bounces for proper scene rendering
    
    // Try GPU first since camera movement is in main thread with OpenGL context
    if (gpu_initialized_ && path_tracer_->isGPUAvailable()) {
        success = path_tracer_->trace_gpu(render_width_, render_height_);
    }
    
    last_preview_time = now;
}
```
