## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story builds on the established project structure from Epic 1, specifically the documented file structure (Story 1.3) which provides:
- Render components location: src/render/ and include/render/
- PathTracer implementation location: src/render/path_tracer.{cpp,h}
- CMake build system integration ready for new source files
- Testing directory structure: tests/render/ for path tracer unit tests

### Architecture Context

#### System Architecture Overview
[Source: architecture/high_level_architecture.md]
The path tracer integrates into the Core Logic layer as the "Path Tracer Module" component:
- **Render Engine** orchestrates the rendering process and manages PathTracer execution
- **Path Tracer Module** implements the path tracing algorithm with ray generation, intersection tests, and light simulation
- **Scene Manager** provides scene information that PathTracer queries during rendering
- **Image Output** receives final pixel data from the rendering pipeline

#### Component Integration Points
[Source: architecture/component_breakdown.md]
**Path Tracer Module responsibilities:**
- Implements the path tracing algorithm, including ray generation, intersection tests, and light simulation
- Queries the Scene Manager for scene information during rendering
- Provides rendered pixel data to the Render Engine for output processing

**Integration with other components:**
- **Scene Manager**: Maintains 3D world state, stores primitives and properties, provides API for scene queries
- **Render Engine**: Orchestrates rendering process, manages Path Tracer execution, sends final image data to Image Output
- **Primitives & Animations**: Contains data structures for each primitive (torus, sphere, pyramid, cube) that PathTracer must render

#### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/technology_stack.md]
- **Programming Language**: C++17 or newer - PathTracer must be implemented in modern C++
- **Build System**: CMake - New source files will be automatically discovered in src/render/
- **External Libraries**: SDL or GLFW for windowing - PathTracer outputs to screen buffer via existing windowing integration

### File Locations and Structure
Based on established project structure:
- **Implementation**: src/render/path_tracer.cpp
- **Public Header**: include/render/path_tracer.h (if needed by other components)
- **Private Header**: src/render/path_tracer.h (if implementation-only)
- **Unit Tests**: tests/render/path_tracer_test.cpp
- **Class Name**: PathTracer (following PascalCase convention)

### Technical Implementation Details

**Core Algorithm Components:**
- Ray generation from camera/eye position through scene
- Intersection testing with geometric primitives from Scene Manager
- Material property evaluation (diffuse, specular, reflectance)
- Light source sampling and direct illumination calculations
- Indirect lighting through recursive ray bouncing
- Monte Carlo sampling for realistic noise patterns
- Sample accumulation for final pixel color determination

**Integration Points:**
- Query Scene Manager for primitive data, positions, materials
- Query Scene Manager for light source information
- Provide pixel data to Render Engine for Image Output processing
- Follow existing render pipeline architecture patterns

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Considerations:**
- Ray tracing is computationally expensive - implement efficient intersection algorithms
- Consider ray depth limits to prevent infinite recursion
- Optimize memory usage for ray data structures

**Architectural Constraints:**
- Must integrate with existing Render Engine orchestration patterns
- Must query Scene Manager using established API patterns
- Must provide output compatible with Image Output module expectations
- Must follow established C++17 coding patterns and naming conventions

**Build System Integration:**
- New files in src/render/ will be automatically discovered by CMake
- Header dependencies will be resolved through established include/ directory structure

### Testing

**Test File Location**: tests/render/path_tracer_test.cpp

**Testing Requirements** (No specific testing strategy document found in architecture docs):
- Unit tests for ray generation algorithms
- Unit tests for primitive intersection calculations  
- Unit tests for lighting calculation accuracy
- Integration tests with Scene Manager data queries
- Integration tests with Render Engine pipeline
- Verification of image output data format and accuracy

**Testing Patterns** (Following established project patterns):
- Use descriptive test names with *_test.cpp suffix
- Mirror src/ directory structure in tests/ directory
- Test both individual algorithms and integration points
