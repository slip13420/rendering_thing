# Story 1.1: Cross-Platform Build System

## Status
InProgress

## Story

**As a** new contributor,  
**I want** a cross-platform build system,  
**so that** I can easily compile the project on my operating system.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The build system works on Linux, Windows, and macOS
2. The build system automatically detects the target platform
3. All required dependencies are configured and linked correctly
4. Build instructions are documented and easy to follow
5. The build produces a working executable for the path tracer application

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Set up CMake build configuration (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create main CMakeLists.txt file
  - [ ] Configure C++17 standard requirement
  - [ ] Add platform detection logic
  - [ ] Set up appropriate compiler flags for each platform
- [ ] Task 2: Configure external dependencies (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add SDL or GLFW dependency configuration
  - [ ] Set up cross-platform library linking
  - [ ] Configure include directories
- [ ] Task 3: Create build scripts (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create build.sh for Linux/macOS
  - [ ] Create build.bat for Windows
  - [ ] Add platform-specific build instructions
- [ ] Task 4: Test build on target platforms (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Test Linux build
  - [ ] Test Windows build
  - [ ] Test macOS build
- [ ] Task 5: Document build process (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create comprehensive BUILD.md or update README
  - [ ] Include troubleshooting section
  - [ ] Add dependency installation instructions

## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: architecture/technology_stack.md]
- **Programming Language**: C++17 or newer - This establishes the minimum language standard requirement for CMake configuration
- **Build System**: CMake - This is the official build system choice for the project
- **External Libraries**: SDL or GLFW for windowing and input - The build system must support linking either library option

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/high_level_architecture.md]
The application is a self-contained desktop application with a clear separation of concerns following a classic rendering pipeline model. The build system must support:
- UI Layer components (UI Manager, User Input handling)
- Core Logic components (Scene Manager, Render Engine, Path Tracer Module)
- Integration between windowing library and internal systems

[Source: architecture/component_breakdown.md]
Key components that the build system must compile and link:
- **UI Layer**: UI Manager, UI Input (requiring windowing library integration)
- **Core Logic**: Scene Manager, Primitives & Animations, Render Engine, Path Tracer Module, Image Output
- All components must be properly linked to support the data flow architecture

### Project Structure Alignment
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for file structure - this will need to be established with the build system implementation.

### Testing
No specific testing strategy found in architecture docs for build system validation.

### Technical Constraints
- Must support C++17 minimum standard
- Must provide cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows, macOS)  
- Must integrate with either SDL or GLFW windowing library
- Build output must be a working desktop application executable
