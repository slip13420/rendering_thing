# Story 2.3: Start/Stop Rendering Process

## Status
Accepted

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to start and stop the rendering process,  
**so that** I have control over when the final image is generated.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User can start the rendering process through a UI control (button/menu)
2. User can stop/cancel the rendering process at any time during execution
3. Rendering process runs in background without blocking the UI interface
4. UI displays current rendering status (idle, rendering, completed, stopped)
5. Render process can be cleanly interrupted without corrupting application state

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story builds on established components from previous Epic 2 stories:
- **Story 2.1 (PathTracer)**: Rendering algorithm implementation that needs process control
- **Story 2.2 (Camera Control)**: Camera position system that integrates with render initiation
- **Render Engine**: Architecture established for orchestrating rendering process
- **UI Manager**: Existing patterns for user controls and interface management

The render process control is the orchestration layer that ties together the path tracer, camera system, and user interface.

### Architecture Context

#### System Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/high_level_architecture.md]
Render process control spans multiple architectural layers:
- **UI Layer**: UI Manager provides user controls and status display
- **Core Logic**: Render Engine orchestrates the complete rendering pipeline
- **Path Tracer Module**: Executes the actual rendering with controllable interruption
- **Threading**: Background execution maintains UI responsiveness

#### Component Integration Points
[Source: architecture/component_breakdown.md]

**Render Engine Responsibilities:**
- Orchestrates the rendering process and manages PathTracer execution
- Initiates rendering thread and manages thread lifecycle
- Sends final image data to Image Output module
- Provides render state and progress information

**UI Manager Integration:**
- Provides user interface controls for starting and stopping renders
- Displays current rendering status and progress
- Handles user input for render control operations

**Path Tracer Integration:**
- Executes under Render Engine control with interruptible execution
- Checks for cancellation signals during rendering loops
- Provides partial results when interrupted

#### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/technology_stack.md]
- **Programming Language**: C++17 - Threading and synchronization primitives
- **Build System**: CMake - Thread library linkage configuration
- **External Libraries**: SDL/GLFW - UI event handling for render controls

### File Locations and Structure

**Render Control Logic:**
- **Implementation**: src/render/render_engine.{cpp,h} - add threading and state management
- **Headers**: include/render/render_engine.h - render state and control interfaces

**UI Integration:**
- **Modifications**: src/ui/ui_manager.{cpp,h} - render control buttons and status display
- **Input Handling**: src/ui/ui_input.{cpp,h} - process render control events

**Path Tracer Integration:**
- **Modifications**: src/render/path_tracer.{cpp,h} - add cancellation checking
- **Threading Support**: Consider render_thread.{cpp,h} if complex threading logic needed

**Testing:**
- **Render Tests**: tests/render/render_engine_test.cpp - state management and threading
- **UI Tests**: tests/ui/ui_manager_test.cpp - control functionality
- **Integration Tests**: tests/render/render_integration_test.cpp - end-to-end render control

### Technical Implementation Details

**Render State Management:**
```cpp
enum class RenderState {
    IDLE,           // No render in progress
    RENDERING,      // Actively rendering
    COMPLETED,      // Render finished successfully
    STOPPED,        // Render cancelled by user
    ERROR          // Render failed due to error
};
```

**Threading Architecture:**
- Main thread handles UI and user input
- Background render thread executes PathTracer
- Thread-safe communication via atomic variables or message queue
- Proper synchronization for state changes and data access

**UI Control Requirements:**
- Start button: Enabled when idle, disabled when rendering
- Stop button: Enabled when rendering, disabled when idle
- Status display: Shows current state with descriptive text
- Progress indication: Optional basic progress feedback

**PathTracer Cancellation Integration:**
- Check cancellation flag at regular intervals during ray tracing loops
- Implement cancellation points in expensive operations
- Clean up partial results and state on cancellation
- Return appropriate status codes for completed vs. cancelled renders

### Technical Constraints

**Threading Considerations:**
- PathTracer execution must not block UI responsiveness
- Thread-safe access to shared data (scene, camera, render state)
- Proper thread cleanup and resource management
- Handle race conditions between start/stop operations

**Performance Requirements:**
- Minimal overhead for cancellation checking during rendering
- Efficient thread creation and destruction
- Quick response to user stop requests (sub-second)

**State Management:**
- Consistent state transitions and error handling
- Recovery from interrupted renders without corrupting application
- Proper initialization and cleanup of render resources

**Architecture Constraints:**
- Must integrate with existing Render Engine orchestration patterns
- UI controls must follow established UI Manager patterns  
- PathTracer modifications must not break existing functionality
- Maintain separation of concerns between UI, threading, and rendering layers

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- tests/render/render_engine_test.cpp - State management and threading logic
- tests/ui/ui_manager_test.cpp - UI controls and status display
- tests/render/render_integration_test.cpp - End-to-end render control testing

**Testing Requirements** (Following established project patterns):
- Unit tests for render state transitions and validation
- Unit tests for UI control functionality and state updates
- Threading tests for background execution and cancellation
- Integration tests for complete start/stop workflows
- Stress tests for rapid start/stop operations

**Test Scenarios:**
- Normal render start and completion workflow
- User cancellation at various points during rendering
- UI responsiveness during background rendering
- Thread safety under concurrent access
- Error handling for render failures
- State recovery after application restart

**Threading Test Considerations:**
- Race condition testing between UI and render threads
- Memory safety testing for shared data access
- Resource leak testing for thread cleanup
- Cancellation timing and cleanup verification
