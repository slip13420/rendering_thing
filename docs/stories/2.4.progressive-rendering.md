# Story 2.4: Progressive Rendering

## Status
Accepted

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to see the image progressively render with a low-sample preview that refines over time,  
**so that** I can get real-time feedback on the rendering process.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Initial low-quality preview appears quickly (within seconds) when rendering starts
2. Image quality progressively improves with additional samples over time
3. Progressive updates are visible in real-time without stopping/restarting the render
4. User can see rendering progress through visual feedback and sample count display
5. Progressive rendering works seamlessly with start/stop render controls

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story builds on the complete rendering foundation from previous Epic 2 stories:
- **Story 2.1 (PathTracer)**: Core sampling and accumulation algorithms that need progressive enhancement
- **Story 2.2 (Camera Control)**: Camera system that remains consistent across progressive passes
- **Story 2.3 (Render Control)**: Background threading and start/stop controls that must work with progressive updates
- **Image Output**: Existing screen buffer system that needs real-time update capability

Progressive rendering transforms the batch rendering approach into an interactive, real-time feedback system.

### Architecture Context

#### System Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture/high_level_architecture.md]
Progressive rendering enhances multiple architectural components:
- **Path Tracer Module**: Generates intermediate results during progressive sampling passes
- **Render Engine**: Orchestrates progressive timing and coordinates real-time updates
- **Image Output**: Handles real-time screen buffer updates and display refresh
- **UI Manager**: Provides progress feedback and integrates with user controls

#### Component Integration Flow
[Source: architecture/component_breakdown.md]
Progressive rendering data flow:
1. **Path Tracer** generates low-sample preview and progressive improvements
2. **Render Engine** manages progressive pass timing and intermediate result processing
3. **Image Output** updates screen buffer with progressive images
4. **UI Manager** displays progress feedback and sample count information

**Enhanced Component Responsibilities:**
- **Path Tracer Module**: Progressive sampling execution with configurable sample targets
- **Image Output**: Real-time display updates and intermediate image processing
- **Render Engine**: Progressive orchestration integrated with existing threading model

#### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/technology_stack.md]
- **Programming Language**: C++17 - Real-time processing and efficient memory management
- **Build System**: CMake - No additional dependencies required for progressive rendering
- **External Libraries**: SDL/GLFW - Screen buffer updates and display refresh integration

### File Locations and Structure

**PathTracer Progressive Enhancement:**
- **Implementation**: src/render/path_tracer.{cpp,h} - add progressive sampling modes
- **Headers**: include/render/path_tracer.h - progressive sampling interfaces

**Render Engine Progressive Orchestration:**
- **Implementation**: src/render/render_engine.{cpp,h} - progressive timing and coordination
- **Progressive Logic**: Consider render_progressive.{cpp,h} if complex logic needed

**Image Output Real-time Updates:**
- **Implementation**: src/render/image_output.{cpp,h} - real-time screen buffer updates
- **Display Integration**: Coordinate with SDL/GLFW display refresh

**UI Progress Integration:**
- **Implementation**: src/ui/ui_manager.{cpp,h} - progress display and sample count UI
- **Status Updates**: Real-time progress feedback elements

**Testing:**
- **Render Tests**: tests/render/path_tracer_test.cpp - progressive sampling accuracy
- **Integration Tests**: tests/render/render_integration_test.cpp - progressive workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: tests/render/progressive_performance_test.cpp - update timing validation

### Technical Implementation Details

**Progressive Sampling Strategy:**
```cpp
struct ProgressiveConfig {
    int initialSamples = 1;      // Quick preview sample count
    int targetSamples = 1000;    // Final quality sample count
    int progressiveSteps = 10;   // Number of progressive improvement passes
    float updateInterval = 0.5f; // Seconds between progressive updates
};
```

**Progressive Rendering Phases:**
1. **Initial Preview**: 1-4 samples for immediate visual feedback
2. **Low Quality**: 8-16 samples for basic scene understanding
3. **Medium Quality**: 32-128 samples for reasonable quality
4. **High Quality**: 256+ samples for final quality refinement

**Real-time Display Integration:**
- Intermediate image tone mapping and gamma correction
- Efficient screen buffer updates without full image recomputation
- Configurable update frequency (e.g., 2-4 times per second)
- Memory-efficient intermediate result storage

**Progress Feedback Elements:**
- Current sample count vs. target sample count
- Samples per second calculation
- Estimated time to completion
- Visual progress bar or percentage indicator
- Progressive quality indicator (Low/Medium/High)

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Considerations:**
- Progressive updates must not significantly slow overall rendering
- Balance between update frequency and rendering performance
- Memory efficient storage of intermediate results
- Minimize UI thread blocking during progressive updates

**Quality Management:**
- Ensure progressive images converge to final quality
- Handle noise reduction across progressive passes
- Maintain color accuracy in intermediate results
- Proper tone mapping for intermediate low-sample images

**Integration Constraints:**
- Must work seamlessly with existing start/stop render controls
- Camera changes should restart progressive rendering
- Scene changes should invalidate current progressive state
- Threading integration with background render execution

**Architecture Constraints:**
- Maintain existing Render Engine orchestration patterns
- Preserve PathTracer algorithm accuracy with progressive enhancement
- Image Output module must handle both final and intermediate results
- UI updates must follow established UI Manager patterns

**Testing Requirements** (Following established project patterns):
- Unit tests for progressive sampling algorithm accuracy
- Unit tests for intermediate image generation and tone mapping
- Integration tests for real-time display update performance

- Performance impact measurement of progressive updates
- Memory usage validation for intermediate result storage

**Quality Validation Tests:**
