    bool transferImageData(GLuint buffer, const std::vector<Color>& imageData);
    bool readbackImageData(GLuint buffer, std::vector<Color>& imageData);
    
    // Memory pool optimization
    void optimizeMemoryPools();
    void defragmentMemory();
    
    // Profiling and monitoring
    MemoryStats getMemoryUsage() const;
    TransferStats getTransferPerformance() const;

    uint32_t type;          // Primitive type enum
    uint32_t materialId;    // Material index
    float padding[2];       // GPU alignment padding
};

// Structure-of-arrays for GPU efficiency
struct GPUSceneData {
    std::vector<GPUPrimitiveData> primitives;
    uint32_t primitiveCount;
    float padding[3];       // GPU alignment
