# Story 1.2: Automatic Dependency Management

## Status
InProgress

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to be able to get all external dependencies automatically,  
**so that** I can set up the development environment quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dependencies are automatically downloaded and configured during the build process
2. No manual installation of libraries is required by developers
3. Dependency versions are locked to ensure consistent builds
4. The system works across all supported platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)
5. Clear error messages are provided if dependency resolution fails

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Configure CMake dependency management (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Set up FetchContent or find_package for SDL/GLFW
  - [ ] Configure automatic download and build of dependencies
  - [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for different library sources
- [ ] Task 2: Lock dependency versions (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Specify exact versions or version ranges in CMakeLists.txt
  - [ ] Document dependency version requirements
  - [ ] Test with locked versions across platforms
- [ ] Task 3: Cross-platform dependency resolution (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test dependency resolution on Linux
  - [ ] Test dependency resolution on Windows
  - [ ] Test dependency resolution on macOS
  - [ ] Handle platform-specific library variants
- [ ] Task 4: Error handling and diagnostics (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add clear error messages for failed downloads
  - [ ] Provide troubleshooting guidance for common issues
  - [ ] Log dependency resolution process for debugging
- [ ] Task 5: Documentation updates (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Update build documentation to reflect automatic dependencies
  - [ ] Remove manual dependency installation instructions
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting section for dependency issues

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story builds on Story 1.1 (Cross-Platform Build System) which established the CMake foundation. The build system must now be enhanced to automatically manage external dependencies.

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: architecture/technology_stack.md]
- **Programming Language**: C++17 or newer - Dependency management must ensure C++17 compatibility
- **Build System**: CMake - Use CMake's built-in dependency management features (FetchContent, find_package)
- **External Libraries**: SDL or GLFW for windowing and input - These are the primary dependencies to manage automatically

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/high_level_architecture.md]
The application architecture requires windowing library integration for the UI Layer. Automatic dependency management must ensure:
- UI Input components can access windowing library APIs
- Integration between external libraries and internal systems is seamless

[Source: architecture/component_breakdown.md]
Key components requiring external dependencies:
- **UI Input**: Requires windowing library (SDL or GLFW) for raw input events
- **UI Manager**: Must interface with windowing system through the external library
- The dependency system must ensure these components can compile and link correctly

### Technical Implementation Details
The dependency management system should:
- Use CMake FetchContent module for automatic source download and build
- Provide find_package fallbacks for system-installed libraries
- Handle both SDL and GLFW options with user choice or automatic detection
- Ensure consistent builds by pinning to specific versions or version ranges
- Support offline builds when dependencies are cached

### Testing
- **Build Testing**: Verify clean builds with no pre-installed dependencies
- **Platform Testing**: Test on Linux, Windows, and macOS with fresh environments
- **Version Consistency**: Verify same dependency versions across different build environments
- **Error Scenarios**: Test behavior when dependencies cannot be downloaded

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with CMake build system established in Story 1.1
- Must support both SDL and GLFW as windowing options
- Must maintain C++17 compatibility
- Should minimize build time through caching mechanisms
- Must provide clear feedback during dependency resolution process
