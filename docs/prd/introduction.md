### 1. Introduction
* **Project Name:** Basic Render Pipeline
* **Product Vision:** To create a simple, open-source, educational 3D renderer using path tracing. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning tool for students and developers interested in computer graphics and rendering algorithms.
* **Target Audience:** Students, hobbyists, and developers who want to learn the fundamentals of path tracing.
* **Problem Statement:** Existing professional rendering software is often too complex and proprietary for educational purposes. There is a need for a minimalist, well-documented project that focuses solely on the core concepts of a path tracing renderer.
