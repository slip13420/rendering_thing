### 4. Technical Requirements

#### Core Platform Requirements
* **TR-1:** The application shall be built using C++17 or a newer standard.
* **TR-2:** The project shall use CMake as its build system for cross-platform compatibility.
* **TR-3:** The application shall use a library like SDL or GLFW for windowing and input handling.
* **TR-4:** The codebase shall be modular, with clear separation of concerns between scene management, rendering, and UI.
* **TR-5:** The project will be open-source and hosted on GitHub.

#### GPU Acceleration Requirements
* **TR-6:** The application shall support GPU acceleration for path tracing computations to achieve optimal performance.
* **TR-7:** GPU acceleration shall be implemented using industry-standard APIs (OpenGL Compute Shaders, CUDA, or Vulkan Compute).
* **TR-8:** The system shall maintain CPU fallback capability when GPU acceleration is unavailable or disabled.
* **TR-9:** GPU-accelerated rendering shall achieve a minimum 5x performance improvement over CPU-only implementation for complex scenes.
* **TR-10:** The application shall support cross-platform GPU acceleration on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

#### GPU Implementation Standards
* **TR-11:** GPU memory management shall be implemented with efficient CPU-GPU data transfer mechanisms.
* **TR-12:** The rendering pipeline shall coordinate GPU compute operations with progressive rendering updates.
* **TR-13:** GPU acceleration shall be optional and configurable through build-time and runtime options.
* **TR-14:** The system shall include GPU driver compatibility validation and graceful degradation.
* **TR-15:** GPU compute kernels shall be optimized for parallel processing with appropriate thread group sizing.

#### Performance and Quality Requirements
* **TR-16:** GPU-accelerated ray tracing shall maintain mathematical accuracy equivalent to CPU implementation.
* **TR-17:** Memory transfer overhead between CPU and GPU shall not exceed 5% of total rendering time.
* **TR-18:** The application shall provide GPU performance profiling and diagnostic capabilities.
* **TR-19:** GPU acceleration shall scale linearly with available GPU compute units for parallelizable workloads.
* **TR-20:** The system shall support GPU-accelerated scene data updates for dynamic primitive management.
