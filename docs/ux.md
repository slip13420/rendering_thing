### UX Document: Basic Render Pipeline

#### **1. Project Overview**

This document details the user experience for a basic path tracing renderer designed as an educational tool. The UX is intentionally minimalist to help users (students and developers) focus on the core rendering concepts without the complexity of a feature-rich, professional application. The UI itself is a part of the renderer's output, serving as an in-scene overlay.

#### **2. User Flow**

The user flow is a simple, linear process:
1.  **Launch Application:** The user launches the executable.
2.  **Scene Configuration:** The user interacts with the sidebar UI to select which primitives they want to include in the scene.
3.  **Rendering:** The user clicks the "Render Scene" button to start the path tracing process. The viewport displays a progressive render.
4.  **Interaction & Review:** The user can stop the render, make adjustments (e.g., camera position), and restart the process.
5.  **Export:** The user saves the final rendered image to a file.

#### **3. UI/UX Wireframes**

The interface is divided into two primary areas: a sidebar for controls and a viewport for the rendered output. 

**Sidebar (Left):**
* **Scene Primitives:** A list of checkboxes for the user to select the primitives to include in the scene:
    * Torus
    * Sphere
    * Pyramid
    * Cube
* **Rendering Settings:** A section for key rendering parameters:
    * **Resolution:** A dropdown menu with preset options.
    * **Samples per Pixel:** An input field for quality control.
    * **Camera Position:** Three input fields (X, Y, Z) for scene navigation.
* **Actions:** A set of buttons to control the rendering process:
    * `Render Scene`
    * `Stop Render`
    * `Save Image`

**Viewport (Right):**
* Displays a real-time, progressive rendering of the 3D scene.
* Includes a progress indicator to show render completion status.

#### **4. Updated Front-End Specifications**

The UI is rendered using the application's own graphics pipeline, not a separate technology like HTML/CSS.

* **UI Components:** All UI elements (buttons, checkboxes, text) will be represented as textured geometric primitives within the scene.
* **Input Handling:** The application will handle raw mouse and keyboard input. Mouse clicks will be translated into ray intersection tests against the UI geometry to determine which element was "clicked."
* **Interaction Logic:** User actions on the UI will directly trigger functions within the renderer's internal API (e.g., a click on "Render Scene" calls the `RenderEngine`'s `StartRender` function).

This UX document provides a clear blueprint for the user-facing part of the **Basic Render Pipeline**, ensuring that the project's design remains simple, consistent, and aligned with its educational purpose.
