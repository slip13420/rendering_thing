# UX: User Flow

The user flow is a simple, linear process:
1. Launch Application: The user launches the executable.
2. Scene Configuration: The user interacts with the sidebar UI to select which primitives they want to include in the scene.
3. Rendering: The user clicks the "Render Scene" button to start the path tracing process. The viewport displays a progressive render.
4. Interaction & Review: The user can stop the render, make adjustments (e.g., camera position), and restart the process.
5. Export: The user saves the final rendered image to a file.
