# UX: Project Overview

This document details the user experience for a basic path tracing renderer designed as an educational tool. The UX is intentionally minimalist to help users (students and developers) focus on the core rendering concepts without the complexity of a feature-rich, professional application. The UI itself is a part of the renderer's output, serving as an in-scene overlay.
