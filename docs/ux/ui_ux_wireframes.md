# UX: UI/UX Wireframes

The interface is divided into two primary areas: a sidebar for controls and a viewport for the rendered output.

## Sidebar (Left)
- Scene Primitives: A list of checkboxes for the user to select the primitives to include in the scene:
  - Torus
  - Sphere
  - Pyramid
  - Cube
- Rendering Settings: A section for key rendering parameters:
  - Resolution: A dropdown menu with preset options.
  - Samples per Pixel: An input field for quality control.
  - Camera Position: Three input fields (X, Y, Z) for scene navigation.
- Actions: A set of buttons to control the rendering process:
  - Render Scene
  - Stop Render
  - Save Image

## Viewport (Right)
- Displays a real-time, progressive rendering of the 3D scene.
- Includes a progress indicator to show render completion status.
