### Product Requirements Document (PRD): Basic Render Pipeline (Revised)

This is a revised version of the PRD that incorporates your feedback, updating the first epic and its user stories to focus on **Project Setup and Scaffolding**.

---

#### **1. Introduction**
* **Project Name:** Basic Render Pipeline
* **Product Vision:** To create a simple, open-source, educational 3D renderer using path tracing. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning tool for students and developers interested in computer graphics and rendering algorithms.
* **Target Audience:** Students, hobbyists, and developers who want to learn the fundamentals of path tracing.
* **Problem Statement:** Existing professional rendering software is often too complex and proprietary for educational purposes. There is a need for a minimalist, well-documented project that focuses solely on the core concepts of a path tracing renderer.

---

#### **2. Epics**

Epics represent high-level features or large bodies of work. They are broken down into multiple user stories.

* **Epic: Project Setup and Scaffolding**
    * **Focus:** Establishing a stable and easy-to-use development environment and initial project structure.
* **Epic: Scene & Primitive Management**
    * **Focus:** The internal systems for managing 3D objects, their properties, and animations.
* **Epic: User Interface**
    * **Focus:** The front-end, self-rendered UI that allows the user to interact with the renderer and its settings.

#### **3. User Stories**

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user.

**Epic: Project Setup and Scaffolding**

* **As a new contributor**, I want a **cross-platform build system**, so that I can easily compile the project on my operating system.
* **As a developer**, I want to be able to **get all external dependencies automatically**, so that I can set up the development environment quickly.
* **As a user**, I want the project to have a **clear, documented file structure**, so that I can easily navigate the codebase.

**Epic: Core Rendering Engine**

* **As a user**, I want the application to render a 3D scene using a **path tracing algorithm**, so that I can see realistic lighting and shadows.
* **As a user**, I want to be able to **control the camera position**, so that I can view the scene from different perspectives.
* **As a user**, I want to be able to **start and stop the rendering process**, so that I have control over when the final image is generated.
* **As a user**, I want to see the image **progressively render** with a low-sample preview that refines over time, so that I can get real-time feedback on the rendering process.
* **As a user**, I want to **save the final rendered image to a file**, so that I can export my work.

**Epic: Scene & Primitive Management**

* **As a user**, I want to **add and remove primitives** (torus, sphere, pyramid, and cube) from the scene, so that I can build a custom scene.
* **As a user**, I want the primitives in the scene to have a **continuous spinning animation**, so that I can see the effects of lighting and reflections in motion.

**Epic: User Interface**

* **As a user**, I want to see a **self-rendered UI overlay**, so that I can interact with the application.
* **As a user**, I want to see **checkboxes for each primitive**, so that I can easily toggle their visibility in the scene.
* **As a user**, I want to see an **input field for the camera position**, so that I can precisely control my viewpoint.
* **As a user**, I want to see a **progress bar**, so that I can track the status of the rendering process.

#### **4. Technical Requirements**
* **TR-1:** The application shall be built using C++17 or a newer standard.
* **TR-2:** The project shall use CMake as its build system for cross-platform compatibility.
* **TR-3:** The application shall use a library like SDL or GLFW for windowing and input handling.
* **TR-4:** The codebase shall be modular, with clear separation of concerns between scene management, rendering, and UI.
* **TR-5:** The project will be open-source and hosted on GitHub.

---

#### **5. Timeline & Release Plan**
* **Phase 1: Discovery & Planning:** Complete (Project Brief, Market Analysis, Product Strategy, System Architecture).
* **Phase 2: Design & Prototyping:** Complete (UI/UX Wireframes, Clickable Prototype, Front-End Specs).
* **Phase 3: Development & Implementation:** In Progress (Dev Setup, Internal APIs, UI Design, Integration Plan).
* **Phase 4: Deployment & Review:** Future (Deployment Plan, QA, Production Release).
* **Target Release:** The initial release will be a `v1.0.0` tagged release on GitHub once all core features and documentation are complete.

---

#### **6. Success Metrics**
* **Community Engagement:** Number of GitHub stars, forks, and community contributions.
* **Educational Impact:** Feedback from students and educators on the project's effectiveness as a learning tool.
* **Codebase Stability:** Low bug report count and a high degree of build reliability across platforms.
