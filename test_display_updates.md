# Progressive Display Update Fix Test

## Issue
Progressive rendering display only updates when mouse is moved, not automatically during rendering.

## Root Cause
SDL requires event processing to update the display. During background progressive rendering, SDL events weren't being pumped, so `SDL_RenderPresent()` updates weren't visible until mouse movement triggered event processing.

## Fix Applied
Added `SDL_PumpEvents()` call in `update_progressive_display()` method to force SDL to process window updates immediately during progressive rendering.

## Code Changed
**File:** `src/render/image_output.cpp`
**Location:** `update_progressive_display()` method around line 185

**Added:**
```cpp
// Force SDL to pump events and update the display immediately
// This ensures progressive updates are visible even during background rendering
SDL_PumpEvents();
```

## Expected Result
Progressive rendering should now update the display automatically every 100ms (10 FPS) without requiring mouse movement or user interaction.

## Test Instructions
1. Run the renderer: `./src/path_tracer_renderer`
2. Press 'M' to start progressive rendering (1->100 samples, 8 steps)
3. Do NOT move the mouse
4. Observe that the display updates automatically every ~300ms as samples increase
5. Progressive updates should be visible at: 1%, 3%, 7%, 13%, 26%, 51%, 100%

## Fix Status
âœ… IMPLEMENTED - SDL event pumping added to force automatic display updates
